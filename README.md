## 👨‍💻 About Me
<p align="center">I am currently a Technician in Social Communication, it only remains the final thesis to obtain the bachelor's degree. In recent years, I have been interested in technologies in general and programming in particular. I feel that this orientation change was very successful, for which I am very proud and I look forward to learn more about different technologies and programming languages. Besides, I have been graduated recently from the Full-Stack Development career at Henry's Bootcamp! And nowadays, I am looking for my first tech job opportunity.</p>
<br>

✔️ Tech Stack: JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Node.js, Express, React, Redux, PostgreSQL, Sequelize, Prisma

🤓 I am very interested in learning and incorporating new technologies, such as TypeScript, Next.js and MongoDB.
