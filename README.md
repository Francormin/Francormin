## 👨‍💻 About Me
<p align="center">After four years of study at Universidad Nacional de Córdoba, I currently have an associate's degree in Social Communication, and I only have the final thesis left to obtain my bachelor's degree. In recent years, I have been interested in technologies in general and programming in particular. I feel that this orientation change was very successful, for which I am very proud and I look forward to learn more about different technologies and programming languages. Besides, I have graduated last year from the Full-Stack Web Development career at Henry’s Bootcamp! And nowadays, I am looking for my first tech job opportunity.</p>

✔️ Tech Stack: JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Node.js, Express, React, Redux, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Sequelize, Prisma, Mongoose

🌱 I’m currently learning TypeScript, Apollo GraphQL and Bootstrap.

🤓 I’m very interested in learning and incorporating new technologies, such as React Native, Next.js, Sass and Tailwind CSS.
